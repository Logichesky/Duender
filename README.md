# Duender

Duender is a conversion project that allows you to turn two old Creality Ender-3 printers into a single CoreXY printer.

The original goal was to reuse as many original components as possible and minimize the number of additional parts that need to be purchased.

## Project history

If you want to see how the project started and what the early versions looked like, I recommend watching the video series on my YouTube channel.

Please note that the current versions already differ significantly from what is shown in those early videos.

## Current status

After many versions and experiments, Duender has partially moved away from its original idea of being the most budget-friendly Ender-3 to CoreXY conversion.

Today it is essentially a modular CoreXY printer project with multiple versions — both budget and advanced.

However, the foundation of almost every Duender is still two old bed-slinger printers.

Duender has existed for more than a year and has multiple official versions and many community modifications. The project continues to evolve.

Although originally created from Creality Ender-3 V1 printers, it has now been confirmed that many other bed-slinger models can be converted to CoreXY in a similar way. In many cases, most parts can be reused without modification.

## Available versions

This repository contains files for three base versions of Duender:

- Wheel version  
- MGN9H version  
- MGN12H version  

Unlike older published versions, these versions use M3 pins for all kinematic idlers. Previously, standard screws were used.

Testing has shown that pin-based versions are more stable and eliminate the common CoreXY issue of belt drift.

---

### MGN9H version

After many tests and experiments, I concluded that the MGN9H version on XY axes is the most optimal configuration.

In this setup, I achieved Input Shaping results of around real **18K acceleration**, assuming:

- Proper assembly  
- High rigidity  
- No mechanical play  
- No binding  

---

### MGN12H version

The MGN12H version works reliably but shows slightly lower acceleration results (around **15K**, under proper assembly conditions).

---

### Wheel version

The wheel version works, but I recommend considering it as a temporary option.

It can achieve around **12K stable acceleration**, but wheels have clear drawbacks:

- Harder to align precisely  
- Wear over time  
- Require periodic adjustment or replacement  

Unlike the earliest wheel versions, this version requires printing MGN9H parts and manufacturing wheel adapter carriages.

Y and Z carriages should ideally be cut from 3 mm aluminum. They can be printed, but this significantly reduces kinematic rigidity.

When upgrading later to MGN9H, you will not need to reprint all parts.

The wheel version has not yet been fully tested.

## Documentation

Until recently, the only instructions for Duender were YouTube videos.

Thanks to the community — especially a user named **TallothEndill** — a detailed and structured full manual now exists.

The manual includes:

- Step-by-step assembly instructions  
- Complete BOM  
- Required parts list  
- Useful links  
- Practical recommendations  

Huge thanks to TallothEndill and everyone who contributed.

At the moment, the manual is still in progress:

*(Insert manual link here)*

Once finalized, it will be permanently integrated into this repository.

## Final notes

Duender is fully open source.

You are free to use it, modify it, and build your own derivatives.

If you find the project useful, any kind of support helps. It allows me to spend more time on development, testing, and experiments.

The project will continue to evolve as new ideas appear and as time allows.

Most discussions and development happen on my Discord server:
